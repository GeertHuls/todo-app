# todo-app

Simple todo app written with react-native and targeting the android platform.
There are 2 versions of the app, one built using Exponent,
the other one with react-native-cli.

Both apps are easy to test using an android emulator from [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/).

## Exponent

Get Exponent from [here](https://getexponent.com/).
Open the ./todo-app/Exponent folder to load the project.
To start the app, click the Device/Open on android (ctrl + d) button
while running an emulated android device.
